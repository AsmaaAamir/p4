            <h2>The Hsitory of Cheesecake: Who made it first...?</h2>
            <p>
                Over 4,000 years ago in the fifth century BC, the ancient Greeks on the island of Samos created the earliest 
                known cheesecake. This rudimentary cheesecake was made with patties of fresh cheese that were then pounded smooth 
                with flour and honey. The creation was then baked on an earthenware griddle before being enjoyed by the masses.
                 Back then, cheesecake was considered a great source of energy and there is evidence showing it was served to 
                 athletes during the first Olympic Games in 776 BC. Cheesecake was also popular as a wedding dessert!
                During the late medieval ages in Europe, cheesecake transformed to include a pastry base in a tart form. The first 
                English cookbook, written in 1390, included multiple variations of the cheesecake recipe that included eggs and various 
                flavor profiles. For the next five centuries, almost every English cookbook included at least one cheesecake recipe, 
                signifying the love the English people had for the delicious dessert. Since the English loved their cheesecake, it is not 
                surprising that the delicacy made its way to the American colonies. In the 1730s, Philadelphia became home to the "Cheesecake House"
                tavern! Martha Washington's prized and gifted cookbook features three different cheesecake recipes, one of which being a cheesecake without a
                crust. These recipes were also flavored with rosewater and other spices. In the 19th century, cheesecake recipes began to feature more subtle
                ingredients like lemon and vanilla.In the 1930s, the basis of the Americanized cheesecake changed dramatically. Traditional curd cheese was
                phased out and replaced with cream cheese, creating a creamier, richer, and tastier treat. Thus, the cheesecake recipes were transforming 
                and the New York cheesecake was born! One of the most famous cheesecake options, the signature and smooth taste comes from the extra egg yolks
                in the creamy cheesecake mix. By the 1900s, New Yorkers became obsessed with the dessert and virtually every establishment offered some variation 
                of cheesecake on its menu.
